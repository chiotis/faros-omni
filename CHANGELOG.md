# Changelog

## 0.1.1 — 2026-10-13 — Updates from Omni itself
- **Updates in the header.** The version installed, the latest release on GitHub with its notes, **Check now**, **Install** and **Undo**. Omni looks for a new version at most every 12 hours, and the header marks one with a dot.
- **Install replaces only the code.** `storage/` (the database, the key) is never in a package and never touched, so no backup is needed first. The steps:
  - download the package and check its size and SHA-256 against `release.json`;
  - unpack it beside the live code, refusing anything outside the code (`storage/`, other folders, links, paths that climb out);
  - swap the code in with renames;
  - ask the new code whether it works (its API and sign-in page).
  - If it does not work, the old code goes back by itself, and the database too if the new code had changed it.
- **Undo** puts back the code of the last update. The old code of the last two updates is kept.
- **Releases** are published by a GitHub workflow when `VERSION` changes. It runs the tests and attaches `omni-<version>.zip` and `release.json` (the version, lowest PHP, SHA-256, size and these notes), built by `scripts/build-release.php`.
- **Tests:** `tests/update.php` updates a copy of Omni from releases on a local stand-in for GitHub: install, undo, a broken release taken back with its database, a package that does not match, one that writes into `storage/`. The unit tests cover what a package may hold, which `release.json` is accepted, the notes, and that a release always builds to the same bytes.
- **0.1.0 has no updater**, so this version goes in once by hand (`git pull`, or upload `system/`, `public/` and the files at the root, never `storage/`). Every later version installs from the Updates screen.

## 0.1.0 — 2026-10-13 — The first Omni
- **Setup.** The first visit asks for the owner's account (name, email, password of at least 12 characters, time zone) and closes once it exists. It is the only account.
- **Sign-in.** Limited to 8 failures per address in 15 minutes. Sign-out ends the session.
- **Sites.** A table of every site, with:
  - its state (healthy, warnings, needs attention, silent, waiting to connect, disconnected),
  - a chip each for health, storage, the last backup, the version and analytics,
  - when it was last heard from,
  - a link to its admin.
- **Filters.** Above the table: all, needs attention, update available, not connected.
- **Adding a site.** It takes a name and gives a connection code. The code is shown once, works once and lasts 24 hours.
- **A site's page.** It shows:
  - what to look at (failed checks, a failed or overdue backup, storage almost full, no report for 48 hours, an update),
  - the health checks, backups and cron job, storage, the version, analytics, the server and its extensions,
  - the latest report as JSON.
  - The owner can rename the site, make a new code to connect it again, or remove it.
- **The API of protocol v1:** ping, connect, signed report and disconnect.
  - The sites' secrets are sealed with libsodium; only the codes' hashes are kept.
  - Requests are refused for a wrong signature, a timestamp more than 5 minutes off, a replayed nonce, more than 64 KB, or a protocol Omni does not speak.
  - A removed site is answered with `410`.
  - Connecting is limited to 10 attempts per address per hour.
- **Tests:** `tests/unit.php` (60 checks), `tests/http.php` (58 checks, a real server), and `tests/seed-demo.php` for sample data.
